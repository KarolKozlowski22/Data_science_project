# Fundamentals of Data Science Project

This repository contains the code and report for the "Fundamentals of Data Science" project, completed as part of the course requirements.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to apply practical algorithms and tools in the domain of modern data analysis. The tasks were centered around the Fashion-MNIST dataset and included the following steps:

1. **Data Summary and Discussion:**
   - Download the Fashion-MNIST dataset.
   - Perform a comprehensive summary of the dataset, including insights into its structure and characteristics.

2. **Reduce Data Dimensionality:**
   - Implement dimensionality reduction techniques on the dataset.

3. **Visualize the Reduced Dataset:**
   - Create visualizations to explore and understand the reduced dataset.

4. **Cluster the Dataset:**
   - Apply clustering algorithms and evaluate the results, considering classification labels.

5. **Split the Dataset into Training and Testing:**
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.

6. **Perform Classification and Evaluate Results:**
   - Implement a classification model and assess its performance.

7. **Consult ChatGPT for Alternate Approaches:**
   - Seek guidance from ChatGPT on steps 3-6 and compare the information obtained with the initially prepared approach.

8. **Report and Code Submission:**
   - Prepare a concise report (10-15 pages) detailing the approach, methodology, and results.
   - Attach the code as an accompanying document or provide a link to the repository.


## Conclusion

The project demonstrated a holistic approach to data science tasks, encompassing data exploration, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and classification. The utilization of alternative methods and the integration of external guidance added depth to the analysis.
